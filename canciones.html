<p> 1. Die With A Smile (derechos de autor)<br>
Ooh
I

I just woke up from a dream
Where you and I had to say goodbye
And I don't know what it all means
But since I survived, I realized

Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow
Nobody's promised tomorrow
So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night
Like it's the last night

If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
If the party was over and our time on Earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while
And die with a smile
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you

Woo-ooh

Ooh, lost
Lost in the words that we scream
I don't even wanna do this anymore
'Cause you already know what you mean to me
And our love is the only war worth fighting for

Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow
Nobody's promised tomorrow
So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night
Like it's the last night

If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
If the party was over and our time on Earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while
And die with a smile
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you

Right next to you
Next to you
Right next to you
Oh-oh-oh

If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
If the party was over and our time on Earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while
And die with a smile
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you

Ooh, ooh
I'd wanna be next to you
<P> 2. Say Yes To Heaven<br>
If you dance, I'll dance
And if you don't, I'll dance anyway
Give peace a chance
Let the fear you have fall away

I've got my eye on you
I've got my eye on you

Say yes to heaven
Say yes to me
Say yes to heaven
Say yes to me

If you go, I'll stay
You come back, I'll be right here
Like a barge at sea
In the storm, I stay clear

'Cause I've got my mind on you
I've got my mind on you

Say yes to heaven
Say yes to me
Say yes to heaven
Say yes to me

If you dance, I'll dance
I'll put my red dress on again
And if you fight, I'll fight
It doesn't matter, now it's all gone

I've got my mind on you
I've got my mind on you

Say yes to heaven
Say yes to me
Say yes to heaven
Say yes to me

I've got my eye on you
I've got my eye on you, mmm
I've got my eye on you
I've got my eye on you

<p> 3.BIRDS OF A FEATHER <br>
I want you to stay
Till I'm in the grave
Till I rot away, dead and buried
Till I'm in the casket you carry

If you go, I'm going too, uh
'Cause it was always you, uh
And if I'm turning blue, please, don't save me
Nothing left to lose without my baby

Birds of a feather, we should stick together
I know I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone
Can't change the weather, might not be forever
But if it's forever, it's even better

And I don't know what I'm crying for
I don't think I could love you more
It might not be long, but, baby, I

I'll love you till the day that I die
Till the day that I die
Till the light leaves my eyes
Till the day that I die

I want you to see, mmm
How you look to me, huh
You wouldn't believe if I told ya
You would keep the compliments I throw ya

But you're so full of shit, hmm
Tell me it's a bit, oh
Say you don't see it, your mind's polluted
Say you wanna quit, don't be stupid

And I don't know what I'm crying for
I don't think I could love you more
It might not be long, but, baby, but I
Don't wanna say goodbye

(Birds of a feather, we should stick together) till the day that I die
(I know I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone) till the light leaves my eyes
(Can't change the weather, might not be forever) till the day that I die
But if it's forever, it's even better

I knew you in another life
You had the same look in your eyes
I love you, don't act so surprised <br>
